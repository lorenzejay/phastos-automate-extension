# phastos-automate (v0.1.0)

Phastos Automate is an extension that executes automations such as launching workspace specific process (terminal, running commands), opening other applications like Spotify or Notion and even opening your browser with the tabs unique for your current work context. Automations run through user preferences such as automatically launching when VSCode finishes opening or triggered through the command palette.

## Features

1. Based on your phastos-automate configurations, you can launch processes from macos built in terminal or Iterm2.
2. Open chromium based browsers like Google Chrome, Brave and even Arc. Select which space for Arc and populate your tabs.
3. Open other applications you have installed.

These are triggered on launch, or using the command palette ->`(command + p)` and searching `Phastos Automate:`

Config through your .vscode/settings file or user settings (be workspace specific)

## Requirements

This extension is designed exclusively for `macOS` users. Please refrain from installing if you're using a different operating system.
